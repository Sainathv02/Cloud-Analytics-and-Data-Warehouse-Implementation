# Cloud-Analytics-and-Data-Warehouse-Implementation

In an era where telecom companies are inundated with data, our project leverages cloud-based solutions to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of user data, enhancing the analysis of customer behavior. By utilizing Python, SQL, and powerful cloud services, we streamline the ETL process, enabling faster, more accurate insights that are essential for maintaining a competitive edge.

Key to our implementation is the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS, which ensures secure data management and connectivity. This architecture safeguards sensitive information while allowing seamless access to our resources.

Our project focuses on a comprehensive telecom dataset sourced from Kaggle, divided into seven tables covering call details, data usage, and recharge information. We harness Apache Airflow for orchestration, Google BigQuery for data warehousing, and Tableau for intuitive visualizations.

Architecture Diagram: An overview of the system architecture, detailing the components and flow of data throughout the project.
Through this initiative, we aim to uncover valuable insights into customer churn, driving effective retention strategies and empowering decision-making. Explore our findings and visualizations to see how data-driven insights can reshape the telecom landscape!
